# GameLab Engagement Analysis
---

## Final Report
**[🔗 View the full PDF report here](GameLab_EDA_Report1.pdf)**  
*A concise summary of findings, visuals, and recommendations.*

This project analyses user behavior data from a video game company to identify key factors influencing player retention and engagement, using R for data cleaning, visualisation and statistical analysis. The goal was to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify usage patterns, segment player types and generate actionable insights to inform product development and marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

- **Client:** GameLab 
- **Role:** Data Analyst
- **Tools Used:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr, R Markdown
- **Dataset:** Simulated player activity logs from over 5,000 users
- **Deliverable:** Full EDA report + insights presentation + product recommendations

## Key Insights
- **Engagement patterns differ by game type:** Game A attracts highly engaged players with higher total playtime, while Game B maintains steady, consistent engagement.
- **Revenue drivers vary:** Game A’s revenue is concentrated among a few high-spending players, whereas Game B generates more predictable, evenly distributed spending.
- **Session length matters:** Longer session durations in Game B may contribute to stronger retention, while Game A relies on a small group of deeply engaged users.
- **Statistical validation:** A/B testing confirmed significant differences in both playtime and purchases between game types, eliminating the likelihood of random variation.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on monetisation for Game B:** Enhance upgrade options to capitalize on its stable spending base.
- **Target high-value players in Game A:** Develop personalised engagement strategies for the subset of heavy users who drive most of the revenue.
- **Leverage retention strategies:** Explore features or incentives that extend player engagement beyond initial sessions.
- **Conduct further experiments:** Test segmentation-based strategies and analyse behavior with real currency to refine revenue forecasts.

## Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning and variable formatting to prepare for analysis
- Exploratory data analysis using distributions, summary statistics and comparative plots
- Comparative analysis by player experience and game type to guide decision-making
- Visualisations created using `ggplot2` to explore trends in playtime and purchases
- Interpretation of findings to support marketing, player engagement and monetisation strategies

## Reflections

This project helped me build confidence in applying R to real-world analytics tasks. I strengthened my ability to clean and transform time-based data, craft visual narratives and communicate insights effectively. With further development, this project could be extended into predictive churn modeling using logistic regression or time series analysis.
