# GameLab Engagement Analysis

This project explores user behavior data from a fictional mobile game, **GameLab**, to uncover factors affecting player retention and engagement. The analysis was completed using R as part of the University of Queensland course **BSAN7204: Data Analytics**.

The goal was to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify usage patterns, segment player types, and uncover actionable insights for product and marketing teams.

## 📈 Project Overview

- **Client:** GameLab (fictional mobile game)
- **Role:** Data Analyst
- **Tools Used:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr, R Markdown
- **Dataset:** Simulated player activity logs from over 5,000 users
- **Deliverable:** Full EDA report + insights presentation

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- 🔁 **Daily login frequency** was strongly associated with long-term retention.
- ⏳ **Session length** and time of day played a role in predicting churn.
- 📆 **Retention dropped significantly** after Day 5 — a key re-engagement window.
- 🧍 Players fell into three clear segments: high-frequency, casual, and churned users.
- 💸 Most in-game purchases occurred within the first 72 hours.

## 📊 Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning and time-series transformation (e.g., login timestamps to session metrics)
- Exploratory data analysis (distributions, boxplots, grouped summaries)
- Player segmentation based on behavioral features
- Visualizations using `ggplot2` to present trends and distributions
- Interpretation of insights for marketing and UX strategy

## ✍️ Reflections

This project helped me develop confidence in using R for real-world analytics tasks. I improved my ability to clean time-based data, build visual narratives, and communicate insights clearly. If expanded, this project could lead to predictive modeling for churn using logistic regression or decision trees.
